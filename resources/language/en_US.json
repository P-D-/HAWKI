    "AboutHAWKI_Info": "The offering was developed in the Interaction Design Lab at HAWK to give all university members the opportunity to integrate artificial intelligence into work processes and to have a space for exchange, potentially resulting in new working methods and fostering an internal university discussion on the use of AI. This offering also aims to provide didactic support, to develop an understanding of the functioning of a language model, and therefore gives indications of well-operating prompts (text inputs) in different areas. We welcome constructive feedback to further develop this offering in line with your needs and insights.",
